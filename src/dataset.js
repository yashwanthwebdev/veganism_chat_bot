  // "hello hey hi":
  // "hey! would you like to talk about why we should all go vegan?",
  "hello hey hi":
    "hey! I am glad that you want to talk to me about veganism. What do you want to ask me?",
  "bye, catch you later, see you, cya ":
    "Bye! I hope that this conversation left you with thoughts and questions to help you see the reason to go vegan?",
  "being vegan harms the environment": "actually, it is the contrary",
  "animals are not intelligent":
    "all animals are intellectually and emotionally sophisticated relative to their own species, and many have thoughts and emotions more complex than those of young human children or the mentally disabled. even so, it is not logical or equitable to withhold ethical considerations from individuals whom we imagine think or feel differently than we do. ",
  "animals kill other animals":
    "non-human animals do many things we find unethical; they steal, rape, eat their children and engage in other activities that do not and should not provide a logical foundation for our behavior. this means it is illogical to claim that we should eat the same diet certain non-human animals do. so it is probably not useful to consider the behavior of stoats, alligators and other predators when making decisions about our own behavior.",
  "we have canine teeth which are meant to tear animal flesh":
    "when humans eat flesh, we don't actually tear it with our cuspids. instead, we soften meat with cooking and then pre-tear it with utensils before grinding it down with our flattened molars, which are particularly well-suited for chewing vegetation. ",
  "eating animals causes diseases":
    "many human diseases come directly from animals. for instance, pigs and birds carry influenza, pigs and dogs carry whooping cough, and cows carry tuberculosis, smallpox, and cowpox. so when we raise and eat animals, we increase our risk of exposure to these and other diseases. further, plants contaminated by animal agribusiness runoff can be vectors of salmonella, which is the primary way spinach, peanut butter, and other plant-based foods come into contact with the bacteria.",
  "you should respect my personal choice to eat animals":
    "from an ethical perspective, it is generally agreed that one individual's right to choice ends at the point where exercising that right does harm to another individual. therefore, while it might be legal and customary to needlessly kill and eat animals, it is not ethical.",
  "naturally and biologically, humans are omnivores/carnivores":
    "the claim that humans are natural meat-eaters is generally made on the belief that we have evolved the ability to digest meat, eggs and milk. this is true as far as it goes; as omnivores, we're physiologically capable of thriving with or without animal flesh and secretions. however, this also means that we can thrive on a whole food plant-based diet, which is what humans have also been doing throughout our history and prehistory.",
  "chickens laying eggs is normal and natural":
    "eating eggs supports cruelty to chickens. rooster chicks are killed at birth in a variety of terrible ways because they cannot lay eggs and do not fatten up as broiler chickens do. laying hens suffer their entire lives; they are debeaked without anesthetic, they live in cramped, filthy, stressful conditions and they are slaughtered when they cease to produce at an acceptable level. ",
  "going vegan is  difficult":
    "the most important way you can do that is to remove animal products from your diet. another important way is to stop wearing animal products such as leather and wool. another is to avoid entertainments that involve animals, such as circuses and zoos. but while these might seem daunting tasks when viewed together, they do not have to be undertaken all at once. most vegans transition to veganism slowly, bringing incremental changes to their lives over time that are easily integrated. you can do this, too.",
  "going vegan is not going to make a big difference. one person is not going to make a huge difference":
    "it is true that large-scale societal changes rarely happen as a result of one person’s efforts. rather, these changes happen when a number of people begin to live in alignment with their shared values. in the case of vegans, more people are beginning to live compassionate lives, and each of them is contributing to a more compassionate world. in this way, the animal rights movement is no different from those of women’s suffrage and racial equality, which were both comprised of many individuals who held in common values of compassion, peace and social justice. ",
  "i don't see anything cruel in eating/consuming honey":
    "bees possess extraordinary intelligence, decision-making ability and even specialized language. they also experience pain. this means that bees are thinking individuals whose needs and wishes are usurped for our benefit when we consume honey. this also means that bees suffer when their honey is taken from them.",
  "we don't have enough vegan food. people will die of hunger":
    "food scarcity is an argument for veganism, not against it. as the world’s population grows and more people are able to afford meat, less food is available overall. this is because we filter protein and energy-rich crops like soy and grain through animals at a substantial loss before eating them. depending on the numbers you want to trust and the type of animal it comes from, each pound of meat requires four to thirteen pounds of feed to produce. by switching to a plant-based diet, the farms that presently grow that feed are able to grow food for people instead",
  "i don't need to become/be vegan to love animals":
    "in order to eat meat, an animal lover must be comfortable with the sexual violation of cows, pigs, sheep, goats and other beings via artificial insemination. in order to drink milk, an animal lover must be comfortable with the separation of a mother cow from her calf and with the raising of that calf in a veal crate for the few months it is permitted to live. in order to eat eggs, an animal lover must be comfortable with the crushing and suffocation of billions of male chicks per year, since males are not useful to the egg industry. none of these things are acts of love.",
  "killing animals in a non-violent/haram way for sacrifice is perfectly fine according to many religions":
    "the practice of animal sacrifice has roots in ancient history, where it existed as a means of interacting with the spirit world for the benefit of a person or community. the act of slaughtering these animals had spiritual connotations, and the sacrificial animals themselves were viewed as beings who gave their lives on behalf of humanity. this same psychology applies today among meat eaters who view the acts of hunting and farming animals as spiritual contracts, who view the slaughter of these animals as a sacrifice, and who view the products derived from that slaughter as gifts from the dead animal. ",
  "what is wrong in eating animals killed in a humane manner?":
    "it is normal and healthy for people to empathize with the animals they eat, to be concerned about whether or not they are living happy lives and to hope they are slaughtered humanely. however, if it is unethical to harm these animals, then it is more unethical to kill them.",
  "eating animals is natural since we are part of the food chain":
    "the terms 'food chain' and 'food web' refer to a natural ecological system whereby producers in a specific habitat are eaten by consumers in that same habitat. the term 'circle of life' has no scientific meaning at all. in neither case do the terms refer to the human consumption of animals, since humans do not exist as consumers in a natural ecological system where cows, pigs, cats, dogs, fish and other food animals are producers.",
  "many religions don't consider eating animals as inhumane":
    "there are many religions with many diverse teachings on the topic of eating meat. in some, there are prohibitions against eating certain animals. in others, it is permissible to both sacrifice animals and eat them. however, it is important to remember that religious permission is not the same as religious imperative. in other words, simply because your religion permits you to eat meat, that does not mean it requires you to do so.",
  "god created animals for food":
    "there are many religions with many diverse teachings on the topic of eating meat. in some, there are prohibitions against eating certain animals. in others, it is permissible to both sacrifice animals and eat them. however, it is important to remember that religious permission is not the same as religious imperative. in other words, simply because your religion permits you to eat meat, that does not mean it requires you to do so.",
  "my religion allows me to eat animals/meat":
    "there are many religions with many diverse teachings on the topic of eating meat. in some, there are prohibitions against eating certain animals. in others, it is permissible to both sacrifice animals and eat them. however, it is important to remember that religious permission is not the same as religious imperative. in other words, simply because your religion permits you to eat meat, that does not mean it requires you to do so.",
  "ancestors had to kill animals to survive":
    "there are many hypotheses about the food our early ancestors ate, what effect it had on their overall health and the evolutionary impacts of their diets. however, while it is certainly true that they ate other animals, it is also true that they did not always do so, just as it is true that individuals, groups and societies have been thriving on plant-based diets throughout history.",
  "traditions allow eating animals":
    "it is easy to confuse culture and tradition with ethics, but these are all separate things, and it is important to understand them as such. there was a time when the keeping of slaves was culturally acceptable, but even so, it was not ethical. in some parts of the world, female genital mutilation is a traditional non-medical procedure, but it is not an ethical one. these are only two of many reasons why it is problematic to equate cultural and traditional practices with ethical behaviors. ",
  "plants have life":
    "vegans draw the line at hurting sentient individuals. plants lack nerves, let alone a central nervous system, and cannot feel pain or respond to circumstances in any deliberate way (not to be confused with the non-conscious reactions they do have). unlike animals, plants lack the ability or potential to experience pain or have sentient thoughts, so there isn't an ethical issue with eating them.",
  "why is wool non-vegan":
    "essentially all wool comes from sheep sheared on industrial farms, which often involves very rough handling of the sheep and is a process which inflicts painful nicks and cuts on the sheep's skin. these injuries attract flies and promote flystrike, especially around their tail where the skin bunches up. to combat this, two strips of wool-bearing skin from around either side of the sheep's buttocks are removed, without using anesthetics, in order to create a scarred area of flesh that's less susceptible to infestations. this process is call mulesing. it is also important to remember that there are no old-animals homes for animals that are no longer profitable to industry, and sheep are no exception. when they age and no longer produce as much wool they are shipped to the slaughter house, and this happens long before their natural lifespan. it's clear that sheep are very much hurt by all of this.",
  "i don't see anything wrong in buying wool. we aren't harming the sheep":
    "essentially all wool comes from sheep sheared on industrial farms, which often involves very rough handling of the sheep and is a process which inflicts painful nicks and cuts on the sheep's skin. these injuries attract flies and promote flystrike, especially around their tail where the skin bunches up. to combat this, two strips of wool-bearing skin from around either side of the sheep's buttocks are removed, without using anesthetics, in order to create a scarred area of flesh that's less susceptible to infestations. this process is call mulesing. it is also important to remember that there are no old-animals homes for animals that are no longer profitable to industry, and sheep are no exception. when they age and no longer produce as much wool they are shipped to the slaughter house, and this happens long before their natural lifespan. it's clear that sheep are very much hurt by all of this.",
  "why is honey non-vegan?":
    "firstly, honey isn't made for us.it’s a raw deal to the bees to steal their food and replace it with industrially-processed corn syrup which is injurious to the bees, which is what most commercial beekeepers do. secondly, the act of harvesting from commercial hives inevitably crushes or injures some of the bees.. thirdly, in conventional beekeeping, honey bees are specifically bred to increase productivity. this selective breeding narrows the population gene pool and increases susceptibility to disease and large-scale die-offs. diseases are also caused by importing different species of bees for use in hives. so, honey is non-vegan.",

  "what is cruel about making honey?":
    "we don't make honey. the bees make it. we just steal from them.",
  "vegan food is not tasty and there aren't enough options":
    "many common foods are already vegan; bread, pasta, rice, fruit, vegetables and so on. all of these foods can be prepared in several ways, and other foods can be made vegan with simple ingredient substitutions. beyond that, many cultures have long traditions of flavourful plant-based cooking, and these offer the opportunity for vegans to expand their culinary palates. so switching to a plant-based diet is not about losing good food experiences, it is only about learning new habits and finding new favourites. ",
  "veganism is just a fad/trend. it will pass away soon":
    "veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude - as far as is possible and practicable - all forms of animal exploitation and cruelty for any reason, including medicine, food, clothing, entertainment or for any other purpose. in dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals. in short, veganism is a philosophical position and not a diet.",
  "not enough b12 is present in vegan food":
    "while it is true that b12 is not produced by plants, it is also not produced by animals. rather, b12 is the byproduct of a specific bacterial fermentation that thrives in soil, some fermented plant matter, dead flesh and the guts of animals. fortunately, this bacteria is easily mass-produced for human consumption now, and many foods are fortified with it, so there is no need to eat animals in order to receive sufficient b12. ",
  "not enough iron is present in vegan food":
    "iron is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, a protein that transfers oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. there are two kinds of iron absorbed by the body; heme and nonheme. heme iron is not regulated by the body, which means it is always absorbed, while nonheme iron is regulated by the body and absorbed when it is needed. both are present in meat, but only nonheme iron is present in plants and fortified foods. this is important because a surplus of this nutrient can be as damaging as a deficiency, and only those people who eat meat or take iron supplements are in danger of a surplus. conversely, a whole-foods, plant-based diet can safely meet the body's iron needs.",
  "not enough protein is present in vegan food":
    "humans need for about 6% of their diet to be comprised of protein, though most doctors recommend 9% just to be sure. many nuts and vegetables contain enough protein to meet this nutritional requirement, so plant-based diets provide adequate protein for human health. ",
  "farmers kill animals by using pesticides to save their crops":
    "crop fields do indeed disrupt the habitats of wild animals, and wild animals are also killed when harvesting plants. however, this point makes the case for a plant-based diet and not against it, since many more plants are required to produce a measure of animal flesh for food (often as high as 12:1) than are required to produce an equal measure of plants for food (which is obviously 1:1). because of this, a plant-based diet causes less suffering and death than one that includes animals.",
  "but  vegans will eat animals if they are stranded in a desert":
    "this argument proposes a hypothetical edge-case scenario (i.e. eating animals on a desert island) as a means of justifying a real-life behaviour (i.e. eating animals on a daily basis). however, this exercise in imagination does not represent a plausible situation people might find themselves in and does not tell us anything about the morality of the vegan addressing the topic. for these reasons, it tends not to be a productive conversation point. ",
  "animal testing is necessary to make medicines ":
    "the primary ethical considerations we must address when examining the necessity of vivisection are the right of animals to be free of experimentation for human purposes and the value of tests performed upon them. in the case of cosmetics testing, it is both selfish and cruel to insist that animals suffer and die for the sake of vanity. a similar argument can be made for household products, which are not necessary for human life. moreover, there are many effective alternatives to animal testing for both cosmetics and household products, which can and should be used instead.",
  "it is not possible to be 100% cruelty free or a perfect vegan":
    "veganism is the philosophical position that exploitation of and cruelty to sentient beings is ethically indefensible and should be avoided whenever it is possible and practicable to do so. vegans themselves do not claim this position is absolute nor do they strive for perfection. rather, the accusation that vegans fail to be vegan because they cannot be perfect is an external one imposed by people who do not understand veganism.",
  "Are zoos vegan?": `No, zoos aren’t vegan – we don’t have the right to keep animals captive. animals are there for the entertainment of humans.Even when that entertainment has a degree of education, animals are still captive for our benefit. Even in zoos where conservation is a priority, there is still the issue that the freedoms and needs of individual animals are compromised in the name of ‘the greater good’. Even ‘good’ zoos simply can’t afford to provide spaces large enough to satisfy the normal roaming and exploring instincts of many animals.And as for bad zoos, some of the conditions can be so cramped and awful that animals suffer from ‘zoochosis’. If you see an animal rocking back and forth, it’s likely that it’s suffering severe mental depression from being cooped up in such confined and inadequate conditions.

  "does seaworld abuse animals": `Yes. Seaworld puts animals in cramped concrete tanks at its marine parks across the country. It builds its business on the suffering of smart and social animals.

  "is going to an aquarium a vegan thing to do": `No. Fish and other sea creatures, like their land-dwelling relatives, are sentient and have a right to live free from human exploitation.

  "is it vegan to have fish in a tank": `Yes. Unless you rescued them and then can't survive in the wild because of valid reasons. Fish are intelligent, sensitive animals who think and feel pain the same way that cats and dogs do. Fish crave stimulation from other fish and from their environment. They are adapted to dwell in the majestic seas—even the biggest, best-maintained aquarium can’t compare to nature.

  "is it ethical to ride horses": `No. They don't want to be ridden since it causes them pain, lameness and discomfort.

  "is bullfighting ethical": `No. bullfighting is a horrific form of animal cruelty. It is a blood sport, a performance broken down into three acts. Each of the first two acts is designed to injure and weaken the bull via blood loss, ready for the heroic matador to enter the stage and deal the killing blow.

  "why should we or i go vegan?":
    "Because animals deserve to live just like we do without getting abused or killed when there are enough plantbased alternatives for humans to thrive on",
  //holocaust
  "vegans are being insensitive when they compare what happen to animals to the holocaust that happened to jews. that is very tasteless and tone-deaf. do you think it is ethical to make this comparison? ": `these are vegan holocaust survivor alex hershaft's own words :
    "my first hand experience with animal farming was instrumental [in devoting my life to animal rights and veganism]. i noted the many similarities between how the nazis treated us and how we treat animals, especially those raised for food. among these are the use of cattle cars for transport and crude wood crates for housing, the cruel treatment and deception about impending slaughter, the processing efficiency and emotional detachments of the perpetrators, and the piles of assorted body parts - mute testimonials to the victims they were once a part of."
    not to mention isaac bashevis singer, who also made the comparison frequently and once wrote1:
    "in relation to [animals], all people are nazis; for the animals, it is an eternal treblinka."
    ok, so hopefully you now see why this comparison can be drawn out-- the methods of slaughter are similar: cold, systematic, needless, cruel. sure, the goal of one was genocide due to hate, and the goal of the other is eating the victims' body due to apathy. obviously, as seen in this thread, this is a comparison that immediately receives criticism any time it is made, which is why i normally refrain from making it in my activism; not because it's viscerally wrong, but because it's not effective. to further explain what we mean when we say this, here is mr. hershaft again:
    "the negative reaction is largely due to people's mistaken perception that the comparison values their lives equally with those of pigs and cows. nothing could be farther from the truth. what we are doing is pointing to the commonality and pervasiveness of the oppressive mindset, which enables human beings to perpetrate unspeakable atrocities on other living beings, whether they be jews, bosnians, tutsis, or animals. it's the mindset that allowed german and polish neighbors of extermination camps to go on with their lives, just as we continue to subsidize the oppression of animals at the supermarket checkout counter."26 million jews were killed in the holocaust, including all of my extended family that i never got to meet. yet we contribute to a system that has so far killed >27 billion land animals just this year.`,

  "what if plants can feel pain too?":
    "even in that case, because of the fact that animals need a lot of plants to survive, you would be killing more plants for making non-vegan food.",

  "aren't plants sentient?": "it hasn't been proved yet",
  "i rarely eat meat":
    "in a world where animals are exploited, brutalised and murdered for a myriad of different reasons, unfortunately “rarely eating meat” does nothing to end animal suffering—in fact, it just adds unnecessary suffering, because the person saying this need not pay for animal exploitation at all. while it may be better to eat less meat than eat lots of it, suggesting that this is ethical or that one is off the hook for doing this is ultimately a false dichotomy because it supposes that the only option for the non-vegan is that they either kill lots of animals or kill few, when the reality is that the moral obligation is simply to not abuse animals at all, and this is possible for them. we would not apply the commit less oppression” solution to any other injustice. no one would say that i will racially abuse fewer people or i’ll beat my spouse less in the face of racism or domestic abuse issues. if something is evil/wrong, the moral obligation is simply to not do that thing. ultimately, the victim who is affected by one's decision to harm them does not care that you are doing it less often. the fact is, they are already being murdered or abused because of that person.",
  "it is the circle of life":
    "you'll have to point me to where the 'circle of life' is in all these slaughterhouse videos, because all i see is torture, abuse, pain, suffering, and misery, for the sole purpose of someone enjoying a 5-minute snack for their own personal pleasure.",
  "what would happen to all the farm animals if the whole world went vegan":
    "the idea of the world just magically turning vegan overnight and all the farmed animals being left to roam free is a nonsensical scenario. the world going vegan is a gradual process, by which the number of people boycotting animal products would increase slowly over time, thus meaning that farm animals were bred less and less to meet demand. the number of farmed animals walking this planet right now is directly relative to the number of people buying animal products. more people eating meat/dairy = more farm animals. more vegans = fewer farm animals. this is just supply and demand!",
  "people would lose their jobs if we all went vegan":
    "that's funny... i don't recall anyone ever writing in to netflix to tell them of their heartfelt concern about all the people being put out of work in the dvd industry because of the trending online switchover to video on demand content? and i don't recall anyone writing a letter to their bank either, criticising them for their switchover to online statements, thus putting all those poor people out of work in the paper industry. and what about when people quit smoking? shouldn't we be concerned about all those people being put out of a job in the tobacco industry? as per usual, people are only ever interested in using this argument when it comes to animal exploitation. but anyway, with the workings of supply and demand, changing the demand for a product can cause an industry to change its tack, so to speak, so any animal farmers who are genuinely interested in staying in business would be encouraged to switch to crop farming, and so on. in any case, the livelihoods of those on the side of the oppressor is not worth more than the lives of the oppressed. just as it would not be ethical to continue human slavery on the basis that plantation owners would be put out of work, so too is it unethical to continue animal slavery for fear of farm owners and slaughtermen being put out of work.",
  "your phone parts were made with slave labour / car tyres contain animal parts":
    "as humans, we are born into a world where all consumerist actions cause harm in one way or another. but to say we shouldn't bother minimising our harm in one area just because we are causing harm in other areas is a complete cop-out. to use an analogy: if you are a lifeguard and see a group of people drowning, should you not bother to jump in and save any because you can't save them all? this is what you're doing when you continue to fund animal oppression simply because you can't stop all oppression.with regards to there being animal products in everyday items such as car tyres, windows, walls, etc., we should not be focusing on 2% of the problem. the 55 billion land animals and 90 billion marine animals massacred every year are massacred by the meat, dairy, egg, leather, wool, and fish industries—not the car tyre industry. not the glass industry. so let us focus on the extremely simple and practical solution of boycotting meat, dairy, egg, leather, wool, etc. and then we can see those industries switch to plant-based alternatives.",
  "humans are superior to animals / we are the dominant species":
    "actually, the opposite is true—humans are the only species on earth whose complete removal would benefit absolutely everything (the air, the oceans, the animals, the forests, the soil, etc.). so the idea that a species whose very existence is detrimental to everything is superior to the existence of those species who actually play a role in the ecosystem, is absurd. the idea that one's own kind is superior to another's own kind is the root of all the oppressions throughout history—hardly something we should be aspiring to. with regards to being the dominant species, and justifying our exploitation of animals on that basis, this is yet another 'might makes right' fallacy. and if we are in a dominant position, why would we even want to rule with violence and cruelty? why rule with an iron fist when we can rule with love and compassion? our role as the most powerful species on this earth should be to protect our planet and its creatures, not destroy it and enslave them.",

    "you going vegan actually will make a difference. a huge one. indeed, in the us alone, 400 million fewer animals were brought into a life of exploitation and suffering in 2014 than 2013, due to a rise in the number of plant-based diets. in the uk, the number of vegans has risen 360% in the last decade, hence why the main chain restaurants there are changing their menus in order to cater to demand. in any case, we are accountable for our own actions. imagine if someone said that, just because burglaries are still going to happen regardless of whether you burgle or not, you might as well burgle. just because others are doing something, that doesn't mean we should be playing a part in it as well.",
  "i buy locally":
    "this phrase is absolutely meaningless. people can live anywhere. they might live next to the factory farm from hell; they might live 3 miles from a farm where animals are tortured for fun; and so on. what does it even mean? it makes no difference to the victims where you buy from. and the distance makes it no less of a crime. if i kill my neighbour's dog, is that less of a crime than if i kill someone's dog in the democratic republic of congo? of course not. all farmed animals meet the same fate, regardless of whatever cute little term it is that the marketers put on the label.",
  "meat,milk,cheese,coffee,tea,bacon,chicken, non-vegan food taste good":
    "how can we morally justify taking someone else's life because we like the way they taste? we cannot justify harming others based on sensory pleasure. if we can, then we can also justify rape because to the rapist it feels good, or theft because the thief gets pleasure from the money or goods they acquire. harming someone else for one's own pleasure is morally reprehensible, and any good person knows that.",
  "vegans act so superior / vegans are so judgemental":
    "veganism is about treating others as equals, not about being superior. it is non-vegans who believe that their tastebuds are superior to all life on earth. as vegans say: 'i don't feel superior because i'm a vegan... i'm a vegan because i don't feel superior'. with regards to being judgemental, vegans judge the majority of life on earth as precious. meanwhile, it is non-vegans who tend to judge all other species as being not worthy of having even basic rights, e.g. the right to be free from harm and exploitation. ",
  "stop forcing your beliefs on others":
    "there is not an ideology on this earth more forceful than carnism. not one. those who eat meat, cheese, and eggs, who wear leather and wool, and so on, force their beliefs on others to such an unimaginable extent that others actually die for their beliefs (by the hundreds of billions per year)—how forceful is that! you also have to laugh at this statement, because if it was the person arguing it who was the one waiting in line to have their throat slit, or was having their babies stolen from them, or was about to be skinned alive, they'd be begging, sobbing, pleading for people like us (vegans) to speak up for them and save them. hell, if you look at it from the victim's perspective, if anything, the question should be: 'why aren't vegans more forceful with their beliefs?'",
  "veganism is a cult/religion":
    "veganism is a philosophy. Religion is getting people to believe in things they can't see. veganism is getting people to see things they don't want to believe.",
  "morality is subjective":
    "to the perpetrator, morality is subjective. to the victim, however, it never is. morality is only ever subjective when the person saying that phrase isn't the victim. i'm yet to see one person who uses this excuse actually abide by its principles when it comes to them. what do i mean by this? simple: anyone who harms others and justifies it by saying 'morality is subjective' should write into their country's law courts and tell them that, should anyone ever harm them (e.g. rape or murder them), the person responsible should not be punished, because hey, morality is subjective, and who would we be to force our beliefs on the person who has raped/murdered them, right? so just like the food chain and the circle of life, the people who use these phrases always exempt themselves from the very rules of it while expecting animals to be victim to it.",
  "animals would eat you if given a chance":
    "this argument is pointless, because you could literally just say that about any animal we don't eat as well, e.g. a cat or a dog. so if this rather bizarre justification can be used to talk about herbivorous animals like lambs, why isn't it used to justify killing and eating animals that, well, actually would eat you if they could, like the lions who get shot on hunting safaris that the world is always up in arms about whenever it happens?",
  "vegans are rude. this pushes me away from changin": `while vegans should not be rude to you, as the vast majority of us were also non-vegans at one point, this is not an acceptable excuse to harm animals. if you don't like vegans, that's fine, but why take it out on animals? are chickens rude to you? then what is the point of this argument?
    by this logic, one could also be put off from eating animal products, given that non-vegans are frequently rude about a variety of things, including subjects involving food. so why not say: "a non-vegan was rude to me once, so i'm not going to eat animal products ever again"?`,
  "veganism and vegan food are expensive": `not true. as a matter of fact, veganism can be as expensive or inexpensive as you want it to be. but pound for pound, a plant-based diet is by far the least expensive one on the planet, given that the staple foods of the most poverty-stricken societies worldwide are rice, beans, lentils, potatoes, bread, and so forth. for much of the world, meat and animal products are a luxury item.`,
  "you've never set foot on a farm": `you don't need to have visited a place in order to decide for yourself that what goes on there is unethical. indeed, most of the places we call evil, we've never visited ourselves. imagine if someone were to say your opinion on nazi concentration camps was invalid because you had never visited one. clearly, this argument is nonsense, especially as veganism is not anything to do with welfare (i.e. how 'humanely' the animals are enslaved and murdered), but rather to do with the basic premise that it is not morally acceptable to use animals at all, regardless of how it is done.`,
  "those animals wouldn’t even exist if we didn’t farm them / those animals will go extinct if the world goes vegan": `a child who is abused by their parents would not exist if it weren’t for their parents—does this mean we should forgive what their parents do to that child. with regards to extinction: there would not be anything morally wrong with a species created by humans actually no longer being bred as our slaves. domesticated animals are essentially a human invention—it’s nothing like the extinction of wild species (in any case, in a vegan world, it’s likely that the few thousands or so remaining domesticated farmed animals in existence would be living in sanctuaries, rather than be erased completely).`,
  "the world is never gonna go vegan": `for a start, every single justice movement in history started out with a tiny number of people who said, “enough!” to use an old cliché, “rome wasn’t built in a day”—and neither will a vegan world be. but that doesn’t mean we should just wave the white flag and leave animals to endure the oppressive hell in which they are entrapped. more importantly, and as mentioned in the answer to the argument "you going vegan won’t make a difference”: you are accountable for your own actions—what other people do doesn’t matter in the slightest.the world will never be free of the rape and murder of humans—so does that mean you should do those things as well, because “the world is never gonna be free of murder”?`,
  "there’s no ethical consumption under capitalism": `it’s ok to believe that buying any product in a capitalist system causes harm. it’s not ok to aim to cause the maximum harm possible while living in that system you hate. and by the logic of this excuse, one could buy literally anything, no matter how depraved, violent, and immoral, and just brush it off by saying “well there’s no ethical consumption under capitalism”, as if buying a child pornography film, for example, is morally the same thing as paying to watch a hollywood movie at the cinema. in this unjust world we live in with its corrupt food system, it is understandable that someone would say there’s no ethical consumption under whatever economic system it may be. but just because human workers are treated badly in whatever industry it may be, that does not give you the right to pay for the most evil and violent acts upon non-consenting chickens and fish, when a non-perfect but more ethical alternative is there.`,
  "it’s part of my culture": ` every single vegan you will ever meet grew up in a culture where veganism is frowned upon and looked at with disdain, where animals are seen as commodities, and where consuming animal flesh or secretions is a part of daily life. so until there is even a single vegan country on this earth (there currently isn’t one, and won’t be for a long, long time), this excuse doesn't make sense. besides, culture is not an excuse for committing acts of violence and oppression. it is part of the culture in several countries to stone women, imprison gay people, and kill blasphemers. does that make it ok?`,
  "veganism is privileged": `just like any diet, plant-based eating is only expensive if you buy a lot of quick-to-eat processed foods, ready-made meals, and products from vegan-specific brands. this is particularly the case for vegan foods that are direct substitutes and are designed to cut down cooking time. with good planning, a vegan diet can be incredibly affordable and even cheaper than one that includes animal products`,
  "veganism is an easy way to lose weight": `plant-based eating can lend itself to a healthier diet and help you to lose weight, as your intake of nutritious and low-calorie foods may increase. but it’s completely possible to eat an unhealthy and fatty vegan diet that could instead make you gain weight. this is especially true if your diet consists mostly of carbs, processed vegan options, and indulgent treats, which are becoming more and more available. whether you’re an omnivore, vegetarian, or vegan, proper planning of your diet is essential if you want to manage your weight.`,
  "it's survival": `vegans are living proof that we do not eat animal products for survival purposes. people eat meat, cheese, milk, eggs, and fish because they enjoy the taste. we can survive and thrive without all these foods (all of which, by the way, there are vegan versions of), and thus we are morally obliged to do so.`,
  //welfare
  "what if i source my meat from a farm where the animals aren’t killed and die of natural causes": `it makes no business sense whatsoever to just breed animals into existence and spend a whole lifetime caring for them and paying for their needs so people can just eat their tough, chewy, cancerous body once they eventually die after several long, expensive decades. `,
  "those animals are bred for that purpose": `bringing someone into existence for the sole purpose of harming them cannot be justifiable under any circumstances. whether an animal is bred for food or not, it is not in the animal's interest to slit their throat and eat them. so this argument, as per all the arguments used for exploiting animals, fails to address things from the victim's perspective. an animal does not care what they are bred for—they just want to live. and it is not our right to dictate a purpose for someone else's life.`,
  //hypothetical statements
  "what if you were on a desert island?": `scenarios that bear no relevance to your actual situation, such as the fantasy idea of being stranded on a desert island like from the tv series ‘lost’ or the movie ‘cast away’, with limited options of what to eat are fun to discuss about but they aren't going to solve the real issues at hand. here’s a better question: what if you weren’t on a desert island? what if you lived in a society with an abundance of supermarkets and greengrocers, and every single day you could choose exactly what you wanted to eat? would you continue to fund the bloodshed and murder of innocent beings, or would you choose the peaceful alternative? the difference between these two scenarios is that one is a fairytale while the other is the reality you face every single day. `,
  "what would happen to all the farm animals if the world went vegan?": `the idea of the world just magically turning vegan overnight and all the farmed animals being left to roam free is a nonsensical scenario. the world going vegan is a gradual process, by which the number of people boycotting animal products would increase slowly over time, thus meaning that farm animals were bred less and less to meet demand. the number of farmed animals walking this planet right now is directly relative to the number of people buying animal products. more people eating meat/dairy = more farm animals`,
  //questions about other organisms
  "what about yeast/bacteria? aren't those life-forms?": `let's assume that bacteria actually were sentient though, which would raise the question of whether it would be ethical to use antibiotics if you had an illness: and the answer is, absolutely yes. why? because there is nothing ethically wrong with anyone using whatever force is necessary to defend themselves. so just as you would have the right to shoot dead a crocodile dragging you underwater to be savaged to death in their fearsome jaws, or a police sniper should have the right to squeeze the trigger if a terrorist has a knife to a hostage's throat, so too should you be able to use antibiotics or use soap in order to defend your own body from attack. there is a huge moral distinction between defending oneself from attack, and actually attacking others unnecessarily.`,
  //nutrition
  "vegans can’t get enough calcium": `like protein, calcium is readily available in a variety of plant-based foods. in fact, some plant-based sources of calcium are better absorbed by the body than dairy milk, such as kale. examples of vegan calcium sources include cabbage, broccoli, kale, and other leafy green vegetables, tofu, fortified plant milks, almonds, chia and sesame seeds, beans and pulses, and bread. whole milk also contains a high fat content, making it an unhealthier source of calcium compared to various plant-based options.`,
  "vegans can’t get enough nutrients and vitamins": `plant-based foods readily provide virtually all the nutrients you need.  iron deficiency is the most common deficiency in the world. this can occur regardless of whether you’re a meat eater or not, as there are often many factors at play. for example, if you do or don’t eat certain foods that affect absorption, as well as menstruation. iron is readily available from many plants. examples include lentils, chickpeas, kidney beans, tofu, cashew nuts, kale, quinoa, pumpkin seeds, dried apricots, figs, and raisins. and about  b12, vitamin b12 is produced by certain microorganisms. it is not naturally found in plants, but animals acquire it when they graze, as the substance from which they can synthesise it (cobalt) can be naturally present in soil. however, in modern animal agriculture, farmed animals are mostly kept indoors and so do not achieve it this way. they are therefore normally given cobalt or b12 supplements. this means that farmed animals are mostly a middle-man for a person’s b12 intake.`,
  "vegans can't get enough iodine": `much like vitamin b12, animals typically achieve iodine via soil when grazing and it is often naturally found in sea life. farmed animals usually receive supplements to prevent deficiency, as they will not always be able to achieve it through grazing. while some plants do contain a minimal amount, this isn’t considered an effective way of achieving iodine. seaweed is an excellent source though (but the amount can sometimes be too high) so a moderate intake may be suitable. the most reliable way for vegans to achieve iodine is by taking a regular supplement.  `,
  "vegans can't get enough omega-3 and omega-6 fats": `omega 3s and 6s are vital for brain health, and the common misconception about them is that they’re only achievable from fish. there are actually a number of plant-based sources, such as various seeds (including pumpkin, sunflower, flax, and chia), walnuts, seaweed, and soya spread.`,
  "people who went vegan have died or fallen sick or have become nutrionally deficient and went back to eating non-vegan diet and are much healthier now": `Firstly, we don't really know if they ate a balanced vegan diet. Even a non-vegan is going to have issus if they don't eat a balanced diet. Secondaly,  as per many nutritionists and health websites, vegan diet has enough nutrition for us to be healthy. Don't forget to take your B12 supplements. Do your own research.

  //food choices
  "a vegan diet is too restrictive": ` there are so many different foods that vegans can still eat, many of which are fundamentals in any type of diet. there is a substitution or alternative for just about every animal product, from meats to milks to chocolates.`,

  "what would you do if your family wasn't vegan?": `veganism is about trying  your best.

I can't be hard on myself for things that I can't have control over.`,

    "you don't have to sacrifice your daily coffee. you can still have delicious  vegan coffee made using oats, soy, peanut, almonds or black coffee.",
  "i don't have time to be vegan": `if you've got time to buy animal products, you've got time to buy fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, lentils, seeds, and grains. being vegan is no more time-consuming than being a non-vegan, so this is a completely redundant excuse. indeed, often the foods that take the longest to cook are animal products. put it this way: it ain't the nut roast that's in the oven for 8 hours on christmas day. add to that routine visits to hospitals and pharmacies that are part and parcel for many people who eat animal products due to their aggravation of our most common diseases, and you'll find that eating animal products turns out to be one of the most time-consuming endeavours you can undertake.`,
  "i don't have access to vegan food": `Unless you are living in a desert or in the polar regions or in a forest, you always have access to vegan food like rice, beans, fruits, veggies, soya, tofu, mushrooms, etc. Vegan diet isn't just about alternatives. There are a lot of staple food that are already vegan`,
  "not everyone in the world can go vegan": `but you can and that's the point. anyone who's reading this has no excuse not to be vegan. unless you're either a.) sitting on a sand dune in the middle of the sahara desert, or b.) sitting in an igloo somewhere in the north pole, in which case i must say, i'm pretty impressed with your wi-fi signal. palming off one's own complicity in animal agriculture onto those living in barren wastelands shows a complete lack of ability to take responsibility for one's own actions. if you are reading this now, that means you have access to either a computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone, which means you also have access to shops and so on.`,
  "there are other important issues going on in the world": `this is known as a fallacy of relative privation, i.e. an appeal to other problems. it is fallacious in several ways: a.) the person saying it likely isn't doing anything (or is completely incapable of doing anything) about these 'other issues' they mention, b.) them eating animal products is doing nothing to actually help those other issues, c.) none of these other issues are preventing them from going vegan, and d.) being vegan does not take more time than being non-vegan, so they can still be vegan and focus on these 'other issues' they allegedly care so much about anyway.`,
  "it's human instinct to eat meat": `for something to be a human instinct, it has to be something programmed into the genetic code of all humans, that every single one of us does naturally and is beyond our control. examples of human instinct include breathing without even thinking about it, jumping/flinching if something catches you by surprise, laughing if you find something funny or if you get tickled, shaking when scared/anxious, shivering when cold, sweating when hot, and so on. so this idea that it is our 'instinct' to eat meat or to hunt/kill animals is simply not true. it's not something your body just does and you have no control over. not once has any human ever eaten meat or killed an animal through 'instinct'. if it's an instinct, why do i and millions of other people not do it? why do we find it so easy to control? why does an animal rights movement exist in the first place? why do you not salivate when you see an animal? why do most people not even want to watch slaughter footage? why do we go "eeew" at the thought of eating certain parts of the animal's corpse?`,

  "is it unethical for a vegan to get/buy vegan food from a non-vegan business": `it is always better to support  a 100% vegan business but if that is not possible, buying vegan options from a non-vegan business is a way of telling that there is demand for vegan stuff. if this will keep the vegan options on the menu, it is a great way to indirectly expose non-vegans to vegan options.`,

  "is eating mussels ok/vegan": `technically, it is not vegan. it is best to leave them alone. while mussels don’t feel pain, they are still technically classified as animals since they don't have a brain that is capable of perceiving pain. on top of that, there is no need to eat them since there are plenty of plantbased food anyway.`,
  "is eating oysters ok/vegan": `no. in nature, only one in 10000 oysters produces a pearl. there are over one billion pearls harvested per year. to meet the high demand we need to cultivate oysters in pearl farms and force them to produce pearls.
    a pearl is an ulcer formed in the oysters when an unknown outside particle get into the shell. it is due to the stress that the oysters produce nacre that’ll eventually become the pearl in a couple of years. so basically the pearl is the result of a disease in the oyster’s body.
    in commercial oyster farms, people need to forcibly open the shell and insert an irritant, usually a piece of tissue from another oyster. some types of oysters can create multiple pearls at the same time depending on the number of irritants inserted. 30% of the oysters die in this process only!
    then oyster farmers wait around 2-5 years to harvest the pearls depending on the desired size. to speed up the production of the nacre and the growth of the pearl, the farmers might change the oysters’ water type or temperature to cause them stress.
    when the pearls have grown big enough and are ready to harvest the farmers open the shells and remove the pearls from the muscle of the oyster. if the oyster isn’t capable of producing more pearls it is killed in this process, otherwise, it is going through the same procedure once again until it is completely exploited.
    the pearls are used to make expensive jewelry, but other parts of the oyster are sold as well. the meat is eaten and the shell can be made into jewelry or buttons as well called the mother of pearl. the parts of the shell that are not suitable for mother of pearl are ground up to feed to chicken for calcium.
    oysters play a very important role in the ecosystem because of their ability to clean the water. however, oyster farming, just like any other monoculture, and wild oyster fishing upset the balance of the environment and are very dangerous to our waters.
    in addition, if oysters are in fact capable of pain or are able to feel, the process of forcing them to grow an ulcer, exposing them to radical conditions and killing them (whether on purpose or not) is cruel and unacceptable.`,

  "are animals sentient":
    "Not all animals are sentient. Many scientists believe that sentient beings must have central nervous systems.

Some even suggest that certain creatures with basic centralized neural systems may not be sentient, however, this is an unresolved subject.",

    "After enough number of studies, it has been well documented and proven that few insects do indeed feel pain. Not enough studies have been done on the rest to surely know if they can feel or not.
